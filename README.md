## My thoughtsðŸ’¬:

This movie is one of the first movie I fell in love when I was a kid that made me like anime. The stunning scenery and the heart shattering plot twist is what caught me and made me appreciate not only cool action and fighting scenes in movies, but also the beautiful scenery and complex story they crafted. Kimi no na wa may not have the most complex story out there but is the first movie that gave me chills and will always have a special place in my memory.
